## About

This plugin adds Anamorphic Flare, a.k.a light streaks, to your Godot scenes. It's good for indoors sci-fi environments and night scenes and is a very common effect in modern war games, like Battlefield. Do not use it in daytime open scenes cause it will make your game look shitty. The effect was inspired by [KinoStreaks](https://github.com/keijiro/KinoStreak) for Unity, but I'm not sure if my implementation is the best one for Godot.

## How to Use

- Download the project data;
- Drag and drop the "addons" folder to your project;
- Enable the plugin at "Project/Project Settings/Plugins";
- Add the "AnamorphicFlare" node as child of your Camera;
- Hit the Play button (the effect is not visible in editor).
